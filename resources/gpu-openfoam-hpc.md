- Type: Korean OpenFOAM GPU acceleration overview
- Shared context:
  - Compares GPU acceleration approaches such as RapidCFD, AmgX, PETSc, and native approaches.
  - Mentions large motorBike benchmark-style performance claims.
- Why it matters:
  - Useful for deciding whether conventional OpenFOAM workflows can be accelerated instead of fully rewriting solvers.
  - Relevant when comparing GPU OpenFOAM vs JAX/native differentiable CFD paths.
- Follow-up:
  - Verify benchmark conditions, solver compatibility, and reproducibility before relying on speedup claims.
