- Why it matters:
  - Directly relevant to differentiable CFD, inverse design, and ML-coupled solver experiments.
  - Useful comparison point for JAX-AMR/JANC-style accelerator-friendly CFD design.
  - Check documentation and example maturity before relying on it for production-grade studies.

## LEX v1.6.0

- Paper: https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-19-1103-2026
- Journal page: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/19/1103/2026/
- Type: JAX-based large-eddy simulation model with GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation
- Why it matters:
  - Shows LES implemented in JAX for atmospheric turbulence/cloud and gray-zone modeling.
  - Combines GPU acceleration with automatic differentiation, making it relevant to learned SGS modeling.
  - Good bridge between differentiable CFD, climate/weather modeling, and physics-ML parameterization research.

## Solver-in-the-loop differentiable coastal hydrodynamics

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.07129
- Type: End-to-end differentiable hydrodynamics / inverse-problem framework
- Why it matters:
  - Demonstrates a solver-in-the-loop route for inverse design/estimation problems where full model replacement is risky.
  - Coastal hydrodynamics is not heat transfer, but the pattern transfers to CFD inverse problems, bathymetry/geometry estimation, and engineering optimization loops.
  - Good reference for coupling differentiable programming with legacy numerical models.

## Learning subgrid interfacial area in two-phase flows

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.23946
- Type: Learned closure / multiphase-flow subgrid modeling
- Why it matters:
  - Targets interfacial area density, a closure quantity that strongly affects heat and mass transfer in two-phase flows.
  - Emphasizes regime-dependent inductive bias rather than a generic black-box model.
  - Relevant to boiling, reactors, thermal systems, and multiphase CFD surrogate/closure work.

## google/jax-cfd

- Link: https://github.com/google/jax-cfd
- Type: JAX-based CFD framework / research prototype
- Why it matters:
  - Representative starting point for JAX-native CFD experiments.
  - Useful for differentiable simulation, ML-CFD prototypes, and educational solver studies.
  - Best treated as a research/prototyping framework rather than a production CFD solver.

## AeroJAX

- Link: https://github.com/arriemeijer-creator/AeroJAX
- Type: Experimental differentiable aerodynamics / JAX flow-simulation project
- Why it matters:
  - Targets real-time flow simulation, control, inverse design, and neural-operator integration.
  - Relevant to aircraft/control-oriented CFD-ML ideation.
  - Experimental and young; keep as a project to watch, not a validated solver baseline.
