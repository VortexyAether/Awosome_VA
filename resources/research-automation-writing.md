# Research Automation & Writing

## PaperOrchestra

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.05018
- Type: Multi-agent framework for automated AI research paper writing
- Why it matters:
  - Targets the conversion of unstructured research materials into submission-ready LaTeX manuscripts.
  - Includes literature synthesis and generated visuals such as plots and conceptual diagrams.
  - Relevant to agentic research workflows, especially for turning CFD-ML experiments and notes into paper drafts.
- Caution:
  - Useful as a workflow reference, but generated manuscripts still need strict human review for correctness, novelty, citation quality, and ethics.

## PaperBanana

- Link: https://paper-banana.org/
- Type: AI academic illustration generator
- Description:
  - Transforms paper text into publication-ready methodology diagrams, statistical charts, and infographics through multi-agent collaboration.
- Why it matters:
  - Potentially useful for quickly producing first drafts of methodology diagrams and paper figures.
  - Could pair with paper-writing workflows, but outputs must be checked for scientific accuracy and visual honesty.

## Overleaf MCP

- Link: https://github.com/mjyoo2/overleafmcp
- Type: MCP integration for Overleaf
- Note: Requires Overleaf Premium plan.
- Why it matters:
  - Could connect AI assistants directly to LaTeX writing workflows.
  - Potentially useful for collaborative paper editing, structured manuscript updates, and automated consistency checks.

## Agent-written technical reports

- Source: shared examples of Claude Code producing simulation code + writing + figures/report PDFs.
- Why it matters:
  - Demonstrates the direction of end-to-end agentic report generation.
  - Useful as inspiration for workflows where agents create simulation scripts, run experiments, generate plots, and draft reports.
- Caution:
  - Treat generated reports as drafts. Numerical validation, physical interpretation, and citations must be audited.

## Towards end-to-end automation of AI research

- Related Korean coverage: https://share.google/wpgQ1kOcfuI8eTUcG
- Type: AI scientist / automated research paper generation
- Shared context:
  - AI system can produce research papers with minimal human involvement and pass an initial peer-review stage.
- Why it matters:
  - Strong signal that agentic research workflows are becoming more credible.
  - Relevant to automated literature review, experiment planning, paper drafting, and review simulation.
- Caution:
  - Research automation still needs human oversight for truthfulness, ethics, reproducibility, and scientific value.

## Feynman: open-source AI research agent

- Link: https://github.com/getcompanion-ai/feynman
- Type: Open-source AI research agent
- Bundled agents:
  - Researcher: gather evidence across papers, web, repos, docs
  - Reviewer: simulated peer review with severity-graded feedback
  - Writer: structured drafts from research notes
  - Verifier: inline citations, source URL verification, dead link cleanup
- Why it matters:
  - Good reference architecture for multi-agent research workflows.
  - Could be useful for maintaining this repository or drafting CFD-ML literature notes.
