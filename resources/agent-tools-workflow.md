  - Combines car-mesh CFD surrogate modeling, Transolver-style architecture, PyTorch DDP, and Kubeflow Pipelines.
  - Useful as a concrete example of moving CFD-ML from notebook experiments toward reproducible training pipelines.
  - Shows the workflow layer needed around neural surrogates: distributed training, pipeline orchestration, and dataset/version discipline.
- Curation note: Very new and unproven; keep as a workflow pattern rather than a recommended dependency.

## FreeCAD Robust MCP server

- Link: https://github.com/spkane/freecad-addon-robust-mcp-server
- Type: FreeCAD MCP bridge / workbench addon
- Why it matters:
  - Exposes FreeCAD through an agent-callable MCP surface, reducing reliance on brittle GUI automation.
  - Useful comparison point for CAD-agent workflows where operations, screenshots, object state, and exports need to be explicit.

- Curation note: Validate on parametric parts and downstream STEP/STL export before recommending for lab use.

## CadQuery MCP server

- Link: https://github.com/mikekuniavsky/mcp-cadquery-server-public
- Type: MCP server for CadQuery artifact generation
- Why it matters:
  - Takes CadQuery code and returns 3MF, PNG, and GLB artifacts, which fits agentic CAD loops where code generation must be rendered and inspected.
  - CadQuery is attractive for CFD/CAE because parametric Python geometry can be versioned, swept, and regenerated.
  - Small early project, but the interface shape is useful for designing reproducible geometry-generation tools.

## sim-benchmark

- Link: https://github.com/svd-ai-lab/sim-benchmark
- Type: Solver-grounded benchmark for simulation agents
- Why it matters:
  - Benchmarks agents on real OpenFOAM and LTspice workflows with deterministic verification, not LLM-as-judge scoring.
  - Requires KPI values to include source provenance so the verifier can re-run extraction commands against produced artifacts.
  - Strong reference pattern for evaluating intelligent engineering agents: artifact correctness and reproducibility matter more than fluent explanations.
- Possible use: Adapt the result schema and provenance checks for VA's OpenFOAM/CAD-to-CAE agent experiments.
- Maturity: early benchmark
- Priority: High

## Agentic AI in Engineering and Manufacturing

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.09633

  - Finds near-term value in structured repetitive work and data-intensive synthesis, while higher-value agentic gains require orchestrating multi-step workflows across tools.
  - Highlights the real blockers VA should design around: fragmented machine-unfriendly data, security/regulatory constraints, weak legacy APIs, verification, auditability, and human-in-the-loop review.
- Possible use: Use as a framing citation for why engineering agents need artifact contracts, provenance, and approval gates rather than autonomous black-box tool use.
- Maturity: qualitative study
- Priority: High

## FoamPilot

- Link: https://github.com/elotech47/foampilot_csc7644
- Type: Natural-language OpenFOAM agent prototype
- Why it matters:
  - Uses retrieval over official OpenFOAM tutorials, then copies and surgically edits a valid template case rather than generating solver files from scratch.
  - This template-first pattern is safer for OpenFOAM automation because syntax, file layout, and solver conventions start from known-good cases.
  - Useful precedent for lab workflows where agents should modify validated cases and report mesh/convergence/post-processing artifacts.
- Curation note: Student/project prototype; evaluate robustness before relying on it.
- Priority: Medium

## SolidworksMCP-TS

- Link: https://github.com/vespo92/SolidworksMCP-TS
- Type: TypeScript MCP server for SolidWorks COM automation
- Why it matters:
  - Exposes SolidWorks modeling, sketching, drawing, export, analysis, and macro/VBA generation through MCP over stdio.
  - The direct-COM vs generated-VBA fallback is a useful implementation pattern for CAD APIs with awkward parameter limits.
  - Explicitly alpha/experimental, but it maps the right engineering surface: geometry creation, drawings, exports, mass/interference checks, and geometry validation.
- Possible use: Track as a Windows/SolidWorks reference when designing deterministic CAD-agent interfaces with validation and export hooks.
- Maturity: alpha / experimental
- Priority: Medium
