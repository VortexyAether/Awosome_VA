# CAD, Geometry & AI-assisted Design

## CADAM

- Link: https://github.com/Adam-CAD/CADAM
- Live app: https://adam.new/cadam
- Type: Open-source text-to-CAD web application
- Why it matters:
  - Turns natural-language prompts and image references into OpenSCAD-based 3D models in the browser.
  - Supports parametric controls and exports to `.STL`, `.SCAD`, and `.DXF`, making it relevant to rapid CAD/CFD geometry prototyping.
  - Built around React/TypeScript, OpenSCAD WASM, Supabase, and Claude API; useful reference for text-to-CAD product architecture.
- Caveat:
  - Generated geometry still needs engineering validation before meshing, simulation, or fabrication.

## ForgeCAD

- Link: https://github.com/KoStard/ForgeCAD
- Type: AI-assisted parametric CAD generation
- Summary:
  - Generates CAD that can be adjusted by parameters.
  - Usable with CLI coding agents such as Claude Code or Codex.
  - Early tests looked plausible but still had errors.
- Why it matters:
  - CAD/geometry generation is a bottleneck in CFD/CAE workflows.
  - Agent-assisted parametric CAD could speed up early design iteration.
  - Needs robust validation for dimensions, constraints, tolerances, and manufacturability.

## Zero-to-CAD

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.24479
- Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ADSKAILab/Zero-To-CAD-1m
- Type: Agentic synthesis of interpretable CAD programs
- Why it matters:
  - Focuses on CAD construction history / parametric program synthesis rather than only mesh or B-Rep outputs.
  - The 1M-scale Hugging Face dataset includes CadQuery programs, operation traces, multi-view renders, STL, and STEP exports for training/evaluating text/image-to-CAD models.
  - Relevant to CFD/CAE because reusable design intent and parameters matter for geometry sweeps and optimization.
  - Worth comparing with FreeCAD/Python agent workflows for controllability and downstream meshing robustness.

## FeatureFox

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.26770
- Type: Panoptic graph segmentation for machining feature recognition in B-Rep CAD models
- Why it matters:
  - Automatic feature recognition is a practical bottleneck for CAD/CAM and manufacturability-aware automation.
  - Sample-efficient B-Rep feature recognition could support design-rule checks before simulation or fabrication.
  - Useful signal for graph-based CAD representations beyond generic 3D shape learning.

## LLM symbolic reflection for mechanical linkage design

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.27962
- Type: LLM-assisted mechanical design optimization
- Why it matters:
  - Combines language-model topology exploration with numerical optimization for linkage parameters.
  - A concrete engineering-design example of agentic search plus deterministic optimization.
  - Pattern may transfer to CAD automation loops: symbolic design proposal → solver/optimizer → critique/refine.

## Design Structure Matrix modularization with LLMs

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.28018
- Type: LLM-assisted engineering design modularization
- Why it matters:
  - Uses engineering context in DSM partitioning instead of treating modularization as only graph optimization.
  - Relevant to complex product/system architecture, CAD assembly planning, and design-automation workflows.
  - Useful weekly-synthesis candidate for “LLMs as context-aware engineering-design heuristics.”


## mcp-freecad

- Link: https://github.com/seansackowitz/mcp-freecad
- Type: MCP server for FreeCAD parametric modeling
- Why it matters:
  - Exposes many small FreeCAD operations as agent-callable MCP tools, with screenshots only when explicitly requested to keep token cost low.
  - Good direction for CAD automation: stable parametric/document/object operations instead of brittle GUI control.
  - Worth testing against CFD geometry workflows that need reproducible STEP/STL export and parameter sweeps.

## freecad-mcp

- Link: https://github.com/blwfish/freecad-mcp
- Type: MCP server for AI-assisted FreeCAD modeling
- Why it matters:
  - Smaller FreeCAD MCP bridge with tool coverage for AI-assisted 3D CAD modeling.
  - Useful comparison point for deciding what a minimal CAD-agent interface should expose.
  - Treat as early-stage until validation on real parametric parts and downstream meshing is checked.

## TOOLCAD

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.07960
- Type: Tool-using LLMs for text-to-CAD generation
- Why it matters:
  - Treats CAD generation as long-horizon tool use with reinforcement learning rather than one-shot text-to-shape prediction.
  - Relevant to agentic CAD automation where valid modeling actions, constraints, and edit history matter.
  - Good comparison point for FreeCAD/CadQuery/OpenSCAD agent workflows.
- Possible use: Use as a paper anchor when evaluating whether CAD agents should learn tool-use policies or rely on scripted prompting.
- Maturity: paper-only
- Priority: High

## Pointer-CAD

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.04337
- Type: B-Rep and command-sequence CAD generation
- Why it matters:
  - Unifies B-Rep geometry with command sequences using pointer-based selection of edges and faces.
  - Accepted by CVPR 2026, making it a visible signal in CAD representation learning.
  - Useful for downstream CAE because editable B-Rep/feature history is more valuable than mesh-only geometry.
- Possible use: Track for parametric CAD reconstruction and future CAD-to-mesh automation pipelines.
- Maturity: paper-only
- Priority: High

## Text2CAD

- Link: https://github.com/Toommo2/Text2CAD
- Type: Agent-driven natural-language to CAD workflow
- Why it matters:
  - Attempts to turn natural language into deterministic and validated CAD artifacts rather than only visual 3D previews.
  - Relevant to CFD/CAE automation because downstream meshing and simulation require reproducible geometry files and validation hooks.
  - Early-stage, but the emphasis on validation is the right direction for engineering use.
- Curation note: Evaluate generated geometry quality and export formats before using in a real CAD-to-CFD loop.

## CADFS

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.01925
- Project: https://voyleg.github.io/cadfs/
- Type: FeatureScript CAD program dataset and framework for VLM/LLM CAD generation
- Why it matters:
  - Reconstructs 450k real-world CAD models as clean executable FeatureScript programs spanning a wider operation set than sketch-extrude-only datasets.
  - Emphasizes editable design history, representation-aligned descriptions, and multimodal annotations rather than mesh-only generation.
  - Strongly relevant to CAD-to-CAE automation because parametric construction history is what enables sweeps, constraints, and downstream meshing checks.
- Possible use: Evaluate as a dataset/model reference for executable CAD reconstruction and text/image-conditioned parametric CAD.
- Maturity: paper + dataset/project page
- Priority: High

## Cascaded Discrete Diffusion for CAD generation

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.05031
- Type: Discrete diffusion model for CAD command and parameter generation
- Why it matters:
  - Models CAD as heterogeneous discrete commands and parameters instead of perturbing CAD tokens in a generic continuous embedding space.
  - Cascades command diffusion and parameter diffusion, which better matches the validity constraints of executable CAD sequences.
  - Useful signal for CAD-to-CAE workflows because valid construction history matters more than visually plausible shape samples.
- Possible use: Compare against autoregressive CAD command generation and CADFS/Zero-to-CAD style executable-program approaches.
- Maturity: paper-only
- Priority: High

## Agent-Aided Design for Dynamic CAD Models / AADvark

- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.15184
- Type: Agentic CAD system for dynamic assemblies
- Why it matters:
  - Extends agent-aided design beyond static objects toward assemblies with moving parts and degrees of freedom.
  - Highlights a practical bottleneck for industrial CAD agents: reasoning about dynamic part interactions, not only generating geometry.
  - Relevant to engineering workflows where mechanism design, constraints, and simulation readiness matter.
- Possible use: Use as a paper anchor for evaluating CAD agents on assemblies such as hinges, linkages, pistons, valves, and other moving components.
- Maturity: paper/prototype
- Priority: Medium
