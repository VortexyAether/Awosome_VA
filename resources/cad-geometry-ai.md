- Maturity: paper-only
- Priority: Medium

## CADCLAW

- Link: https://github.com/sunnyday-technologies/CADCLAW
- Type: STEP assembly validation suite / MCP-exposed CAD checks
- Why it matters:
  - Runs automated assembly checks for inventory, interference, adjacency, dimensional constraints, orientation, floating parts, color/material metadata, tolerance stacking, BOM-vs-CAD drift, disassembly, and rendering.
  - Fits the missing validation layer between AI-generated CAD and downstream CAE: geometry should produce evidence before meshing or simulation.
  - MCP exposure makes it relevant to agentic CAD workflows where assistants need callable validation tools instead of visual inspection alone.
- Possible use: Use after CadQuery/build123d/FreeCAD generation to gate STEP artifacts before OpenFOAM meshing or thermal simulation.

  - More visible than many small FreeCAD MCP experiments, so it is a useful candidate for comparison testing.
  - Could support VA-style duct, heat-sink, bracket, and parametric sweep workflows if paired with export and meshability checks.
- Possible use: Sandbox a simple heat-sink/duct generation task and require named faces, bounding box, STEP/STL export, and mesh pre-check evidence.
- Maturity: active early tool
- Priority: High

## multiCAD-mcp

- Link: https://github.com/AnCode666/multiCAD-mcp
- Type: Multi-CAD MCP bridge
- Why it matters:
  - Attempts to expose multiple CAD tools through a common MCP-style interface for AI assistants.
  - Important ecosystem signal: CAD-agent infrastructure is fragmenting across vendor/tool bridges, making common artifact contracts more important.

  - Useful pattern for CAD-to-CAE workflows where generated parts must pass dimension, manufacturability, export, and meshability gates before simulation.
- Possible use: Adapt its PR-gate pattern for VA's parametric heat-sink/duct generation workflows.
- Maturity: early open-source tool
- Priority: High

## manifold-mcp
